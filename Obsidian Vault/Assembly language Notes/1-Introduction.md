**Modern Computers (high level)**
* Complex devices
	-Casual user…
	--pre-packaged programs and operating systems
 * Programmable
	-“User friendly” high level languages: C++, Java, Python…
	-But a lot goes on to support this…

**Modern Computers (lower level)**
* Digital circuits
	-Built using Very Large Scale Integrated circuits (VLSI)
		--Numerical - based on binary arithmetic
			---Why? Easier to make circuits with only 2 states
			---as opposed to base-10 (decimal)
	-More on this later…
* Complex architectures
* Lower level programming
	-Instructions, as well as data, are binary codes/numbers
	-Require many steps to accomplish even simple tasks
	-Not “user friendly”
		--but it forms the basis for higher-level languages

**Goal of this course:**
* Take a peak “under the hood” of a modern computer
	-Not absolutely necessary to use a computer
	-But… it will make you a better computer scientist!
* Use a “ground-up” approach to learn about:
	-Digital Logic and Circuit Design
	-Machine architecture
	-Low level programming

**Course Overview:**
* Digital Logic
	-Examine basic principles of digital logic
		--Boolean operations
		--Binary Arithmetic
* Logic Circuit Design
	-Design basic logic circuits that implement logical and mathematical functions
		--Using “Logisim”
		--Combinatorial and sequential circuit design

* Machine architecture
	-Examine major components of a computer
		--Central Processing Unit (CPU)
			---Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), Control Unit (CU), …
		--Memory
	-Discuss implementation using digital circuits
* Concentrate on the Intel x86 family of processors
	-Underlying processor for Windows PC’s

* Low level programming
	-Machine code
	-Assembly Language
		--Basis for higher level languages like C++ and Java
* MASM (Microsoft Macro Assembler)
	-Windows based assembler
	-Visual Studio
		--Use core libraries supplied with Irvine textbook

**Virtual Machines**
* Begin with the concept of a “Virtual Machine”
	-An abstraction
	-Computer is thought of as having multiple layers
* Layers are a combination of software and hardware
* Each level builds on capabilities of the lower level
