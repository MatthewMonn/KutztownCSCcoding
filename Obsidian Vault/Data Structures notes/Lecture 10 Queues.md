**The ADT Queue**
* Like a line of people  
	– First person in line is first person served  
	– New elements of queue enter at its back  
	– Items leave the queue from its front  
* Called FIFO behavior  
	– _First In First Out_

**Applications of Queue**
* Task scheduling  
	– Print job queue, call center routing, buffering  
* Event handling  
* Allocation of resources like memory or CPU

**The ADT Priority Queue**
* Organize data by priorities  
* Priority value  
* Operations  
	– Test for empty  
	– Add to queue _in sorted position_  
	– Remove/get entry _with highest priority_
