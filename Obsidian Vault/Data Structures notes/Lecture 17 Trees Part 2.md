**Binary Search Tree (BST)**
* A Binary Tree with the additional condition: The value in each tree node is
	– greater than all values in left subtree  
	– less than all values in right subtree

**Creating a BST**
* Initial tree is empty  
* Insert following letters in order given  
	– J, N, B, A, W, E, T
* Initial tree is empty  
* Insert following numbers in order given  
	– 8, 2, 6, 7, 4, 9, 3, 1  
* Give the preorder, inorder, postorder traversal

**Inorder traversal of a BST**

**Efficiency of Binary Search Tree Operations**
* Max number of comparisons for retrieval, addition, or removal  
	– The height of the tree  
* For a BST with n nodes,  
	– The height is minimum (*O(log n)*) when the tree is balanced

**Worst case and average case**
* Adding entries in sorted order  
	– Produces maximum-height binary search tree  
* Adding entries in random order  
	– Produces near-minimum-height binary search tree
